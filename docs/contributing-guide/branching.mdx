# Branching

By default, we use a variation of the Gitflow workflow.

<PageOutline/>

## Gitflow Workflow
As a contributor, you will need to follow the ["Daily Development"](#daily-development) section and to ensure that your commits are well-organized and follow the ["Conventional Commits"](#conventional-commits) section.

### Daily Development
We have two major branches: `master` and `develop`. Common development takes place on `feature branches`, which are created by naming a new branch with `feat/` in front of the name.
Feature branches are based on `develop` and can be merged into `develop` after CR. To merge a feature branch into `develop`, we use the Pull Request.
A Pull Request is the only way to merge features to `develop`. `master` is protected and never touched. Neither branch from nor merge into `master`.
As a convention, we use the GitHub issue number to reference a feature branch i.e. `feat/#CL-456_add_modal_component`. We use this reference to link issues with feature branches.

#### Types of feature branches
`feat/` is a prefix for feature branches, but it's not the only type of branch. We can also create:
* `fix/` - for bug fixes
* `docs/` - for documentation changes
* `test/` - for test changes
* `chore/` - for changes that don't modify src code

### Releases
Before releasing a new version, we create a release branch. We use the `release/` prefix to name the release branch.
A release branch is protected so no new features can be added to it, only bug fixes, documentation, and other tasks related to the release should go in this branch.
This branch is based on `develop` and is merged into both `master` and `develop` after the release.

Releases are tagged with a version number. We use the `v` prefix to name the tag.

### Hotfixes
Sometimes released versions are not working as expected. We can create a `hotfix/` branch to fix urgent issues.
Hotfix branches are based on `master` and are merged into `master` and `develop`. In the name of the branch, we use `hotfix/` and the new version number, i.e. `hotfix/v1.0.1` if the released version is `v1.0.0`.

### Merging
To keep the git log clean, we use **squash commits** to merge feature branches into `develop`.
To merge a feature branch into `develop`, we always use a Pull Request.

## Conventional Commits
Infermedica's Component Library uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/), i.e. a commit message that follows a specific format.
Conventional Commits allow us to keep track of the changes in a project, to make it easy to understand the changes, and to automatically generate changelogs.
To keep the commit messages consistent, we use the commitlint package and "config-conventional" ruleset as a commit-msg hook.

### Types of commits:
* `feat:` - A new feature
* `fix:` - A bug fix
* `docs:` - Documentation only changes
* `test:` - Test-related changes
* `chore:` - Changes that don't modify src or test files
* `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `release:` - A release commit


e.g. of valid commit messages:
* `feat: Add a button component`
* `fix: Prevent triggering search when the input is empty`
* `docs: Correct the spelling of CHANGELOG`
* `test: Add tests for the buttons component`
* `chore!: Drop an image component`

You can also add some scope to the commit message, e.g.:
* `docs(storybook): Add a Figma addon`
* `test(unit): Add tests for an input component`
* `feat(components): Add a button component`
